# Matrix Black theme for the recent versions of Gedit (v46+)

# Installation
The default theme directory for gedit is ~/.local/share/libgedit-gtksourceview-300/styles/ so all you need to do is:
1. Clone the repo / download the theme file:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewpayne68/matrix-black-gedit46
```

2. Copy the theme to the intended location:
```bash
cd matrix-black-gedit46
cp *.xml ~/.local/share/libgedit-gtksourceview-300/styles/
```

3. Select the Matrix Black theme in gedit (under Preferences / Font & Colours)

Et Voil√†. Enjoy.

EDIT: I have also uploaded a Black version of the popular Dracula Theme.
